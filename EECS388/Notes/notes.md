### Overview of the topics

### Embedded Systems
* Computers are desigend for a specific purpose
* *Modern embedded systems contain a large number chips or integrated circuits (ICs)*


##### Types Digital, Analog, and Mixed Signals
* **Digital IC**
    * Microprocessor
* **Analog Ic**
    * Sensors
* **Analog-mixed -signal**
* Contains both digital and analog in a single chip/IC

##### Embedded vs. general computing systems: Number of Applications
* Embedded:
    * Not end-user programmable, On-time
    * Power, memory & compute limited: i.e. smartwathch, implantable device
* General computing:
    * End-user programmable, Faster is awlays better!
    * Greater resouce! i.e. servers

### Internet of Things (IoT)
* **Internet** connected embedded systems
* Interconnection to the internet of devices is important

### Cyber-Physical Systes (CPS)
* Cyber system (computer) + physical system (Plant)
* Embedded systems but integration emphasied

### Real-Time Systems
* The correctness not only logical and computation but produced at the correct time
* A CORRECT VALUE AT THE WRONG TIME IS A FAULT

### Trends in modern embeded systems
* Trending towards: cheaper, powerful, and more connected
* The ECU computing capactiy in BMW i8 is greater than the i3 ( developed in 2014 or earlier )
* Rasberry pi 2 had even greater speeds
    * @ 4,744 MIPS (Millions of instructions per second) 1.0 GHz
* Human like intelligence in modern vehicles
* **Super computer introduced on a car in tesla 2019**
    * Full Self Driving Chip
    * Whats inside
        * CPU
        * GPU (1Ghz, 600 GLOPS) ( GIGA FLOPS ) GIGA FLOPS that is some cool shit man!!!!!!
        * Neural processing units to handle floating points

### Performance
* Processing real time from sensors in cars has increased a lot
* Autombile changes described in three step process]
    * **Inform**
        * Drivers wanted a way to meld lifestyle and car
    * **Assist**
        * Assisting drivers
    * **Assume**
        * communicate collaborate and fufill all functions

### Efficiency
* Size weight, power, and cost constraints are all decreasing as time progresses

### Safety
    Examples below are examples of things that have outside influences and can have failure
* *Examples
    * Therac 25
        * Computer controlled radiation therapy
    * Arian 5
        * Rocket destroyed in 40 seconds

### Security and Privacy
    Confidentiality issues: Infromation could be stolen

* Attack can be done in many ways
    * **Side channel leakage** : Observing the power consumption of the chip to guess the passwords
    * **Hardware or software trojan** : hidden functionality in software or hardware that leaks information to outsider
    * **Physical Attack** : Some dude touches your stuff and does some nasty stuff to it
###### .
    Integrity issues: An attacmed can start a failure inside a system

* Attack can be done in many ways
    * **Fault Inejection** : Change voltage to corrupt output
    * **Hardware or software trojan** : hidden functionality in software or hardware that leaks information to outsider
    * **Physical Attack** : Tampering mode or chip on your own hardware (i.e. your xbox series x version x installing xtynine)

### My Garbage Summary
* Limited Function computers in real world
* Requirements: perfromance, efficiency, safety, secrutiy, and privacy
