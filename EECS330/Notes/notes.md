# What problems can algoriths solve?
* #### Managing big data on the internet
    * Search Enginge for findign data

# Why Study Algorithms ?
* #### Algorithm is a technology you should master
    * advacned computer artitecture
    * efficient algoirthms
    * machine learning
    * mobile devices
    * fast networking both wried and wireless
* ##### Consider sorting the list of n = 10^7 numbers as an example
    * #### **Insertion Sort** takes time C1N^2 where c1 is a constant
    * Suppose this is run on a fast computer that can do a numver of instructions
    * Suppose the code is optimized such taht c1 = 2
    (2* (10^7)^2 instructions) = 20000 instructions
* #### **Merge sort** takes time C1N logn where c1 is a constant
    * Considering this running on slow computer it would only take 1163 making it more optimized for the solution
